# Current Task

- task: 브라우저 코멘트에 따라 가격과 플랜을 낮추고 런칭 할인처럼 보이도록 조정한다.
- phase: verification
- status: complete

# Orchestration Profile

- score_total: 4
- score_breakdown: pricing_positioning=2, public_copy_update=1, local_browser_verification=1
- hard_triggers: browser comment on pricing positioning mismatch
- selected_rules: spec-first, frontend implementation, local verification
- selected_skills: none
- selection_reason: 현재 역량/시장 진입 단계에 맞게 가격 부담을 낮추고 공개 화면에는 런칭 할인 적용가로 자연스럽게 표현한다.
- execution_topology: single-session
- agent_budget: 0
- efficiency_basis: 단일 모달 마크업/CSS 수정이라 분리 비용이 더 크다.
- spawn_decision: no-spawn
- reason: score_total 4이고 가격 섹션과 문서 가격표의 일관성 수정이라 단일 세션에서 수정과 검증을 끝낸다.

# Writer Slot

- main: owns static frontend clone, docs update, and `STATE.md`
- writer_slot: main
- write_sets:
  - `STATE.md`: task state and verification record
  - `index.html`: static landing page UI
  - `styles.css`: visual clone, responsive layout, animation styling
  - `script.js`: interactions and micro interactions
  - `api/inquiries.js`: same-origin intake API contract and email dispatch boundary
  - `PLAN.md`: implementation plan note if product scope changes
  - `README.md`: current intake API deployment note

# Contract Freeze

- contract_freeze: frozen
- source: latest user request, README positioning, current static page
- deliverables:
  - Lower Basic, Standard, and Fix PR displayed prices.
  - Add original price and launch discount visual treatment.
  - Keep pricing copy honest without exposing internal confidence/experience wording.
  - Preserve Lucide SVG icon usage instead of handmade CSS/text icons.
- risks:
  - Do not create misleading fake scarcity.
  - Do not regress pricing layout on desktop/mobile.
  - Keep README price references aligned with the page.

# Reviewer

- review_required: self-review only
- review_reason: static frontend and security-service content wording
